/*
* Project Description:
* This is a sample bootloadable program demonstrating PSoC 5LP bootloading PSoC 3.
* The project is tested using two DVKs - One with PSoC 3 on CY8CKIT-030 and the second one
* with PSoC 5LP on CY8CKIT-050. PSoC 3 must be programmed with the UART_Bootloader Program and
* PSoC 5LP must be programmed with UART_Bootloader_Host program. The UART_Bootloader_Host program
* contains the *.cyacd file associated with the Bootloadable2 program. 
*
* The following events happen on each trigger of the button P6 [1] of CY8CKIT – 050 (PSoC 5LP):
*
* On first switch press, Bootloadable1.cyacd file will be bootloaded onto the target PSoC 3. 
* On successful bootloading the message “Bootloaded - Hello” will be displayed on the char LCD of  
* CY8CKIT – 050 and the message “Hello” will be displayed on the char LCD of CY8CKIT-030.
*
* For subsequent bootloading operation press the switch P6 [1] on CY8CKIT – 030. This makes PSoC 3 to enter bootloader 
* and be ready to bootload a new application.
*
* On next switch press on CY8CKIT – 050, Bootloadable2.cyacd file will be bootloaded onto the target PSoC 3. 
* On successful bootloading the message “Bootloaded - Bye” will be displayed on the char LCD of CY8CKIT – 050 LCD and the message “Bye” 
* will be displayed on the char LCD of CY8CKIT – 030.
